      <p>Hello! I am Abby Reyna. I had a very early exposure to coding at the age of 14 only to realize 14 years later that I am incredibly passionate about it. I first stumbled upon HTML back in the MySpace era. Having a cool profile was the biggest thing so I found myself spending a great amount of time changing up my profile. I would find cool profiles so that I could then scour the entire HTML for the tags and code thanks to the 'view page source' tool. One of the more memorable things I did to my profile was hiding an embedded music player that would autoplay once the page loaded as well as having using a GIF that I repeated and made as my background. HTML was so much fun to me and I wish I would have stuck with it but I am firm believer that everything happens for a reason.</p>

      <p>As my fate would have it, I stumbled upon an ad for the UCLA Coding Bootcamp and without second thought, I signed up for it. The Bootcamp has shown me that I absolutely love coding. It's such a fulfilling feeling when your code is successful after spending a good amount of time trying to figure out why the code isn't working. And as someone that loves learning, I look forward to continuing my education in coding and web development once I finish with the program.</p>

      <p>In my free time, I love to play video games and explore the outdoors with my German Shepherd named Thunder. <img src="https://i.ibb.co/CWFY9rs/IMG-68811.jpg" alt="Thunder :D"></p>
